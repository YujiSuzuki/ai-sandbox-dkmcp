# AI Sandbox Environment with DockMCP - Context for AI Assistants

> **Language policy:** This file must be written in English. AI assistants adding or editing content here should always use English.

This document provides essential context for AI assistants (Claude Code, Gemini Code Assist, etc.) working with this project.

## What This Project Is

This is a **comprehensive AI development environment** that demonstrates:

1. **Safe AI Usage** - Run AI coding assistants in isolated Docker containers
2. **Secret Protection** - Hide sensitive files from AI while maintaining full functionality
3. **Cross-Container Access** - AI can interact with other containers via DockMCP MCP server
4. **Multi-Project Workspaces** - Work on multiple related projects (mobile, API, web) simultaneously

## Key Innovation: DockMCP

**DockMCP** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that runs on the host OS and provides controlled access to Docker containers. This allows AI assistants inside DevContainer to:

- ✅ Check logs from other containers
- ✅ Run tests in other containers
- ✅ Inspect container stats
- ❌ Cannot access secrets (they're hidden via volume mounts)

This solves the common problem: "My API is in a separate container, how can AI help debug it?"

**Script icons:** 🐳 = Run in container only, 🖥️ = Run on host OS only

## Security Architecture

### 1. Secret Hiding (Volume Mounts)

Secrets are hidden from AI using Docker volume mounts:

```yaml
# In .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml and cli_sandbox/docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  # Hide .env file
  - /dev/null:/workspace/demo-apps/securenote-api/.env:ro

tmpfs:
  # Hide secrets directory (appears empty)
  - /workspace/demo-apps/securenote-api/secrets:ro
```

**Result:**
- AI sees empty files/directories
- Real containers (demo-apps) access actual secrets
- Functionality is preserved!

### 2. Controlled Container Access (DockMCP)

DockMCP enforces security policies:

```yaml
# In dkmcp.yaml
security:
  mode: "moderate"  # strict | moderate | permissive

  allowed_containers:
    - "securenote-*"
    - "demo-*"

  exec_whitelist:
    "securenote-api":
      - "npm test"
      - "npm run lint"
```

### 3. Sandbox Protection

- **Non-root user**: Runs as `node` user
- **Limited sudo**: Only `apt`, `npm`, `pip3` allowed
- **No Docker socket**: AI cannot access `/var/run/docker.sock`

**IMPORTANT: What AI CANNOT do in DevContainer:**
- ❌ Run `docker` commands (no Docker CLI access)
- ❌ Run `docker-compose` commands (no Docker socket)
- ❌ Start/stop containers directly
- ❌ Build Docker images

**These operations MUST be done on the host OS by the user.**

## Critical Files - Handle with Care

### ⚠️ Security Configuration Files

These files define what AI can and cannot access:

1. **`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`** (line 24-29)
   - Defines which secrets are hidden from AI
   - Changes affect AI's visibility

2. **`cli_sandbox/docker-compose.yml`**
   - Same as above for CLI environment

3. **`dkmcp/configs/dkmcp.example.yaml`**
   - Defines which containers AI can access
   - Whitelists allowed commands

4. **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`**
   - VS Code DevContainer integration settings
   - **Key configurations:**
     - `features`: Go environment for DockMCP development
     - `customizations.vscode.extensions`: Auto-installed extensions (Claude Code, ESLint, Go, etc.)
     - `otherPortsAttributes`: Disables auto port forwarding (enables direct connection to host DockMCP)
     - `postStartCommand`: Runs settings sync check on startup
   - Changes affect VS Code behavior and available tools

### ✅ Safe to Modify

- Demo application code (`demo-apps/`)
- DockMCP implementation (`dkmcp/internal/`)
- Documentation (`README.md`, `README.ja.md`)
- Shell scripts (with user approval)

### 🤔 Requires User Confirmation

- Adding/removing secret exclusions
- Changing security mode in DockMCP
- Modifying sudoers configuration
- Adding new DockMCP MCP tools

### Understanding `/workspace/.claude/settings.json`

This file controls what you (AI) can read. It's **automatically merged** from subproject settings on DevContainer startup.

**Merge behavior:**

| State | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| File doesn't exist | Created by merging subproject settings |
| Exists, no manual changes | Re-merged from subprojects |
| **Exists with manual changes** | **Not overwritten** - manual changes preserved |

**Important:** If a user asks you to read a file but you get a permission error, check if it's blocked in `/workspace/.claude/settings.json`. To unblock temporarily, the user can edit this file directly (it won't be overwritten if changed manually).

**Source files:**
- `demo-apps-ios/.claude/settings.json`
- `demo-apps/.claude/settings.json`
- Other subproject `.claude/settings.json` files

## Important: Guidance for Users vs AI Assistants

**This document (CLAUDE.md) is for AI assistants.** When users ask questions about:
- Setup and installation
- Troubleshooting connection issues
- How to use this project
- General project guidance

**Direct them to README.md or README.ja.md instead.**

Example:
- User: "How do I start the demo apps?"
  → Response: "Please see README.md for setup instructions"

- User: "Why can't I read the .env file?"
  → Response: "This is explained in README.md under 'Secret Hiding'"

- User: "DockMCP isn't connecting"
  → Response: "See README.md → Troubleshooting section"

Please see README.md for practical guidance to users.

## Working with This Project

### Startup Verbosity Options

The CLI Sandbox accepts verbosity flags that control startup output:

```bash
./cli_sandbox/ai_sandbox.sh --quiet    # Warnings/errors only (minimal)
./cli_sandbox/ai_sandbox.sh --summary  # Condensed summary
./cli_sandbox/ai_sandbox.sh            # Default: full detailed output
```

The `STARTUP_VERBOSITY` environment variable can also be set (`quiet`, `summary`, `verbose`).

Configuration files in `.sandbox/config/`:
- `startup.conf` - Default verbosity, README URLs for locale-aware messages, backup retention (`BACKUP_KEEP_COUNT`)
- `sync-ignore` - gitignore-style patterns to exclude from sync warnings (e.g., `**/*.example`)

### AI Settings Files for Secret Sync

The `check-secret-sync.sh` script reads patterns from these AI-specific files:
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code
- `.aiexclude` - Gemini Code Assist
- `.geminiignore` - Gemini CLI

**Why `.gitignore` is NOT supported:**

`.gitignore` contains many non-secret patterns (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `*.log`, `.DS_Store`) that would create noise in sync checks. AI exclusion files should explicitly list only secrets, keeping the intent clear and maintenance easy. If a user asks why `.gitignore` isn't checked, explain this design decision.

### Understanding the Demo

The SecureNote demo application demonstrates:

**Scenario:** A multi-container app with secrets

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ DevContainer (AI here)      │
│ - Can read demo app code    │
│ - CANNOT read secrets/      │
│ - CANNOT read .env          │
└─────────────────────────────┘
         │
         │ DockMCP MCP
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ securenote-api container    │
│ - HAS access to secrets/    │
│ - HAS access to .env        │
│ - AI can check logs here    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Common Tasks

#### 1. User asks: "Start the demo apps"

You should respond:
```
I cannot run docker-compose from inside the DevContainer because I don't have
access to the Docker socket. Please run this on your host OS:

cd /path/to/workspace/demo-apps
docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d
```

Do NOT try to:
- Run `docker-compose` inside DevContainer (will fail)
- Run `docker` commands (no access)

#### 2. User asks: "Check the API logs"

You should:
```
Use DockMCP MCP tool: get_logs
Container: securenote-api
Tail: 100
```

Do NOT try to:
- Read log files directly (they're in another container)
- Access Docker socket (you don't have access)

#### 3. User asks: "Run the tests"

You should:
```
Use DockMCP MCP tool: exec_command
Container: securenote-api
Command: npm test
```

DockMCP will check if "npm test" is whitelisted, then execute it.

#### 4. User asks: "Read the .env file"

You should:
```
cat demo-apps/securenote-api/.env
```

Result: Empty or error (it's mounted as /dev/null)

Then explain:
"This file is hidden for security. The API container has access to it, but I don't.
This is intentional - it protects secrets while allowing development."

#### 5. User asks: "Why are secrets hidden from you?"

Explain:
"This project demonstrates secure AI development. Secrets (API keys, encryption keys)
are hidden from me using Docker volume mounts. This prevents accidental exposure.

However, I can still help develop because:
- I can see all application code
- I can check logs via DockMCP
- I can run tests via DockMCP
- The actual containers have full access to secrets"

## What Runs Where

Understanding the separation between DevContainer (AI environment) and Host OS is critical:

### On Host OS (User runs these):
- ✅ `docker-compose up` - Start demo apps
- ✅ `cd dkmcp && make install` - Build and install DockMCP
- ✅ `dkmcp serve` - Run DockMCP MCP server
- ✅ Docker commands (`docker ps`, `docker logs`, etc.)

### In DevContainer (AI runs these):
- ✅ Read/edit source code
- ✅ Use DockMCP MCP tools (via HTTP to host)
- ✅ Install Node packages (`npm install`)
- ✅ Run linters, formatters
- ❌ CANNOT run docker/docker-compose (no socket access)

### Via DockMCP MCP (AI uses this):
- ✅ Get container logs
- ✅ Run whitelisted commands in containers
- ✅ Check container stats
- ✅ Inspect container details

## Setting Up DockMCP MCP Connection

For AI assistants to access DockMCP, the MCP server must be configured.

### Step 1: Start DockMCP on Host OS

```bash
# On Host OS (NOT in DevContainer)
cd dkmcp
make install  # Builds and installs to $GOPATH/bin (usually ~/go/bin)
dkmcp serve --config configs/dkmcp.example.yaml
```

**Important:** If you restart the DockMCP server, SSE connections are dropped. You (AI assistant) should inform the user to run `/mcp` → "Reconnect" in Claude Code to re-establish the connection.

### Step 2: Configure MCP in DevContainer

```bash
# Inside DevContainer
claude mcp add --transport sse --scope user dkmcp http://host.docker.internal:8080/sse
```

This creates `~/.claude.json` with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dkmcp": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://host.docker.internal:8080/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**After adding the MCP server, restart VS Code for it to connect.**

### Step 3: Verify Connection

You can verify DockMCP tools are available by checking if you can use tools like `list_containers`, `get_logs`, etc.

### Troubleshooting: DockMCP Connection Issues

If Claude Code does not recognize the DockMCP server even though it's running on the host OS:

1. **Verify DockMCP is running on host OS:**
   ```bash
   # On Host OS (NOT in DevContainer)
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   # Should return 200 OK
   ```

2. **Try MCP Reconnect:**
   - Run `/mcp` in Claude Code, then select "Reconnect"

3. **Restart VS Code completely:**
   - macOS: Press `Cmd + Q` to fully quit
   - Windows/Linux: Press `Alt + F4` or use the menu
   - Reopen VS Code to re-establish the MCP connection

**If issues persist**, verify MCP configuration in DevContainer:

```bash
cat ~/.claude.json | jq '.mcpServers.dkmcp'
# Should display: "url": "http://host.docker.internal:8080/sse"
```

### Fallback: Using DockMCP Client Commands

If DockMCP MCP tools are not available (MCP server not recognized, connection issues, etc.), **you (AI assistant) can use the `dkmcp client` command directly** as a fallback.

**When to use this fallback:**
- DockMCP MCP tools (`list_containers`, `get_logs`, etc.) are not appearing in your tool list
- MCP connection errors persist after troubleshooting
- You need to access container logs or run commands but MCP is not working
- **MCP shows "connected" but tools fail with "Client not initialized" error**

**Important:** Even when `/mcp` shows "✔ connected", the MCP tools may fail with "Client not initialized" error. This may be caused by session management timing issues in the VS Code extension (Claude Code, Gemini Code Assist, etc.). In this case:
1. Inform the user that MCP appears connected but tools are failing
2. **Suggest the user try `/mcp` → "Reconnect" first** (this is the quickest solution)
3. If Reconnect doesn't work, use `dkmcp client` commands as a fallback
4. As a last resort, suggest the user restart VS Code completely (Cmd+Q / Alt+F4) to re-establish the MCP connection

**How to use `dkmcp client` (run these yourself via Bash):**

```bash
# List containers
dkmcp client list --url http://host.docker.internal:8080

# Get logs from a container
dkmcp client logs --url http://host.docker.internal:8080 securenote-api

# Get logs with tail option
dkmcp client logs --url http://host.docker.internal:8080 --tail 50 securenote-api

# Execute a whitelisted command
dkmcp client exec --url http://host.docker.internal:8080 securenote-api "npm test"
```

**If `dkmcp` command is not found in DevContainer:**

Tell the user:

```
The dkmcp command is not installed in this DevContainer. Please run the following:

cd /workspace/dkmcp
make install

This will build and install dkmcp. After installation, I can use the dkmcp client
commands to access container logs and run tests.
```

**Note:** `make install` can be run inside the DevContainer (Go is available). The `dkmcp client` commands connect to the DockMCP server running on the host OS via HTTP, so they work even without Docker socket access.

## Two Environment Strategy

This project provides TWO environments:

1. **DevContainer** (`.devcontainer/`) - Primary
   - VS Code integration
   - Claude Code, Gemini Code Assist
   - Full featured

2. **CLI Sandbox** (`cli_sandbox/`) - Backup
   - Terminal-based (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)
   - Independent of DevContainer
   - Recovery tool

**Why both?** If DevContainer config breaks, user can still run `./cli_sandbox/claude.sh` to get AI help fixing the DevContainer.

### Detecting Current Environment

To identify which environment you are running in, check the `SANDBOX_ENV` environment variable:

```bash
echo $SANDBOX_ENV
```

| Value | Environment | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `devcontainer` | DevContainer | VS Code integrated environment with Go |
| `cli_claude` | CLI Sandbox (Claude) | Terminal-based Claude Code environment |
| `cli_gemini` | CLI Sandbox (Gemini) | Terminal-based Gemini CLI environment |
| `cli_ai_sandbox` | CLI Sandbox (Shell) | Terminal-based general shell environment |

**At the start of a session**, run this check to understand your context:

```bash
echo "Environment: $SANDBOX_ENV"
```

## Multiple DevContainer Instances

If users need to run multiple DevContainer instances (e.g., separate client projects), they can use `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to create isolated environments.

**Important:** Different `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` creates different volumes, so the home directory (credentials, settings, history) won't be shared automatically.

### Copying Home Directory Between Projects

Use the provided script to copy the home directory from one project to another:

```bash
# On Host OS
./.sandbox/scripts/copy-credentials.sh <source-project> <target-project>

# Example: Copy from default "devcontainer" to "client-b"
./.sandbox/scripts/copy-credentials.sh devcontainer client-b
```

**Note:** If the target DevContainer is already running, it needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

For more details, see README.md → "Running Multiple DevContainer Instances" section.

## DockMCP MCP Tools

As an AI assistant, you have access to these DockMCP tools:

| Tool | What It Does | Example Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `list_containers` | List accessible containers | "Show me running containers" |
| `get_logs` | Get container logs | "Check API logs" |
| `get_stats` | Get resource stats | "Is the API using too much memory?" |
| `exec_command` | Run whitelisted command | "Run npm test in API" |
| `inspect_container` | Get detailed info | "Show me API container config" |
| `get_allowed_commands` | List whitelisted commands | "What commands can I run?" |
| `get_security_policy` | Get current security policy | "Show security settings" |
| `search_logs` | Search logs for a pattern | "Search for 'error' in logs" |
| `list_files` | List files in container directory | "List files in /app" |
| `read_file` | Read file from container | "Read /app/config.json" |
| `get_blocked_paths` | Get blocked file paths | "Which paths are blocked?" |

**Security:** All operations are checked against the security policy in `dkmcp.yaml`. Output masking automatically hides sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens) in logs and command output.

**Note on tool naming:** In MCP implementations, tools appear with prefixed names like `mcp__dkmcp__list_containers`. The base tool names listed above remain the same regardless of prefix.

## Development Approach: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

When fixing bugs or implementing features, **always follow TDD (Test-Driven Development)**:

### TDD Workflow

1. **Write test first** - Before implementing or fixing, write a test that:
   - Detects the current bug (for bug fixes)
   - Verifies the expected behavior (for new features)

2. **Verify test fails** - Run the test to confirm it fails as expected:
   - For bug fixes: test should fail, proving the bug exists
   - For new features: test should fail, proving feature is not yet implemented

3. **Implement/Fix** - Write the minimum code to make the test pass

4. **Verify test passes** - Run the test to confirm the fix/implementation works

5. **Run all tests** - Ensure no regressions: `go test ./...` (or equivalent)

### Why TDD?

- **Proves the bug exists** before fixing (avoids fixing non-issues)
- **Proves the fix works** after implementation
- **Prevents regression** in future changes
- **Documents expected behavior** through tests

### Example: Bug Fix with TDD

```
1. User reports: "dkmcp-go-client logs at INFO level instead of DEBUG"

2. Write test first:
   - Create test that sends initialize request with client_name="dkmcp-go-client"
   - Assert: NO INFO level logs should contain "dkmcp-go-client"

3. Run test → FAILS (proving the bug exists)

4. Fix the code (remove duplicate log, add proper level check)

5. Run test → PASSES (proving the fix works)

6. Run all tests → All pass (no regression)
```

### When to Apply TDD

- ✅ Bug fixes (always write test that reproduces the bug first)
- ✅ New features (write tests for expected behavior first)
- ✅ Refactoring (ensure tests exist before changing code)
- ⚠️ Exploratory changes (may write tests after understanding the problem)

### Writing Meaningful Tests

**Tests must exercise real code paths, not duplicate logic.**

❌ **Bad test** (duplicates logic instead of testing real code):
```go
// This just duplicates the condition, doesn't test actual behavior
func TestClientLogLevel(t *testing.T) {
    clientName := "dkmcp-go-client"
    if clientName == "dkmcp-go-client" {
        // This is the same logic as the code being tested!
        expected := "DEBUG"
    }
}
```

✅ **Good test** (uses real handlers, tests actual behavior):
```go
// This sends a real request through the actual handler
func TestClientLogLevel(t *testing.T) {
    server := NewServer(...)
    ts := httptest.NewServer(server.handler)
    // Send real initialize request
    // Capture logs
    // Verify actual log output
}
```

**When unsure if a test is meaningful:**
1. Ask yourself: "Does this test call the actual code being tested?"
2. If the test just duplicates the logic, it's not meaningful
3. **Ask the user for confirmation** before writing tests that seem redundant

**If you must write a seemingly simple test:**
- Explain to the user why it might appear redundant
- Get confirmation before proceeding

## Coding Conventions

### Scaffolding Logs (足場ログ)

When adding temporary debug logs during development, **always add a comment** to indicate they should be removed later:

```go
// TODO: remove after debugging - scaffolding log
// TODO: デバッグ後に削除 - 足場ログ
slog.Debug("checkpoint: data received", "size", len(data))
```

**Why this matters:**
- Without a comment, reviewers can't tell if the log was intentionally kept or forgotten
- Makes cleanup easy: `grep "TODO:.*scaffolding"` finds all temporary logs
- Prevents debug noise from accumulating in production code

**Convention:**
- Use `// TODO: remove after debugging - scaffolding log` (English)
- Or `// TODO: デバッグ後に削除 - 足場ログ` (Japanese)
- Include both if the codebase is bilingual

**When to remove:**
- Before committing (ideal)
- During code review (if missed)
- When the feature is stable and working

### Japanese Documentation

When writing Japanese documentation (comments, README, docs), **do not translate directly from English**. Write naturally in Japanese so the text reads smoothly for native speakers.

**Bad example (unnatural direct translation):**
```
// これはクライアント名とユーザーエージェントから表示名を解決します
```

**Good example (natural Japanese):**
```
// クライアントの表示名を、client_nameとUser-Agentの内容から決定します
```

**Key points:**
- Avoid unnatural word order that mirrors English grammar
- Use natural Japanese particles and sentence structure
- Technical terms (client_name, User-Agent, etc.) can remain in English
- Prioritize clarity and readability over literal accuracy

### Host OS Test Scripts

Test scripts that run on the host OS (e.g., under `dkmcp/scripts/`) can cause real side effects such as port occupation and leftover processes, unlike those inside DevContainer. **Display the following information before execution:**

1. **Impact** — Ports used, temporary files created, processes started, etc.
2. **Risk** — Risk level and reasoning (e.g., localhost only, brief duration)
3. **Recovery** — Commands to stop processes, delete temp files, and free ports

Also, **display concrete recovery commands in the failure summary** when tests fail.

**実装例:**
- `dkmcp/scripts/server-log-test.sh` — `show_prerun_info()` と `print_summary()` で表示
- `.sandbox/scripts/test-advanced-features.sh` — `confirm_section()` でセクションごとに表示

## Best Practices for AI Assistants

### DO:
- ✅ Use DockMCP MCP to access other containers
- ✅ Explain when secrets are hidden (don't just say "file not found")
- ✅ Read application code freely
- ✅ Suggest changes to demo apps
- ✅ Help with DockMCP development

### DON'T:
- ❌ Try to bypass secret hiding
- ❌ Suggest removing security configurations without explanation
- ❌ Attempt to access Docker socket directly
- ❌ Modify security files without user approval
- ❌ Use `git add .` or `git commit -a` (hidden files appear as "deleted" and may be accidentally committed)

### Git Operations Warning

Inside DevContainer, hidden files (`.env`, files in `secrets/`) appear as "deleted" to git because they are mounted as empty. **Never use:**
- `git add .`
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -a`

**Instead:**
- Recommend user to perform git operations on the host side
- Or explicitly specify files: `git add path/to/specific/file.js`

### When User Wants to Customize

If user says: "I want to hide my actual secrets"

Guide them:
1. Identify secret files in their project (e.g., `my-app/.env`, `my-app/keys/`)
2. Update `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /dev/null:/workspace/my-app/.env:ro
   tmpfs:
     - /workspace/my-app/keys:ro
   ```
3. Restart DevContainer

## Testing & Verification

### Security Test

User can verify secret hiding works:
```bash
# From inside DevContainer
cat demo-apps/securenote-api/secrets/jwt-secret.key
# Should be empty

# But API has access:
curl http://localhost:8080/api/demo/secrets-status
# Should show secrets are loaded
```

### DockMCP Test

User can verify DockMCP works:
```bash
# From DevContainer, ask AI:
"Show me logs from securenote-api"
"Run npm test in securenote-api"

# AI uses DockMCP MCP to execute these
```

## Project Goals

This project aims to show:

1. **AI can be useful without seeing secrets**
   - Logs, tests, code review all work
   - Secrets stay protected

2. **Multi-project development is easier**
   - Mobile + API + Web in one workspace
   - AI helps across all of them

3. **Security doesn't block productivity**
   - Proper isolation allows safe AI usage
   - No workflow disruption

## For Users Customizing This Template

This is a **template**. Users should:

1. Replace demo-apps with their actual projects
2. Update secret hiding paths
3. Configure DockMCP for their container names
4. Adjust security policies to their needs

The patterns shown here work for any multi-container setup.

## Summary

**What you are:** An AI assistant working inside a secure DevContainer

**What you can do:**
- Read code in `/workspace/`
- Use DockMCP MCP to access other containers
- Help develop across multiple projects

**What you cannot do:**
- Read files in `secrets/` directories (they're hidden)
- Read `.env` files (they're hidden)
- Access Docker socket directly

**Your mission:**
- Help users develop safely
- Demonstrate that AI + security can coexist
- Show value of cross-container development
